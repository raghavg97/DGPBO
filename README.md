# Bayesian Optimization with Stochastic Imputation of Deep Gaussian Process (DGP-SI-BO)

The DGP surrogate model code is from [here](https://github.com/mingdeyu/DGP). Along with DGP_SI-BO, several other comparison methods to replicate the results from the article ([preprint available](https://www.techrxiv.org/doi/full/10.36227/techrxiv.23548143.v1)) are also provided.
